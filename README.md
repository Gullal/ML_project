# ML Bonus Project on Next Word Prediction
Algorithm for assisting users in typing by predicting the next word(s) using a POS n-Gram model. 
The approach is slightly different from the conventional word based approach as we used Parts-Of-Speech information also to find a more effective ranking function for the top-k word prediction.
